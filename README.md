 Adds some console commands to help print things out as csv's, made with easily updating the Wiki in mind. 

I generally use "clear" to clear the console, then use the command, followed by "condump filename.csv" as this avoids timestamps, things just need a little formatting afterwards but are mostly good to go. 
 
 Commands I've added are : 
 
givebps
giveallbps
print_dyes
print_trails
print_frames
print_item
print_hcskills

but you can see the format I'm using, and it's pretty easy to develop into other things, should you wish.
